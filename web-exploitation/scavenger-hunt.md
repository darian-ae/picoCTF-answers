This challenge requires you to navigate around to different files within the site:
- `robots.txt` - this file can be used to disallow web crawlers and Google from indexing your page.
- `.htaccess` - this is the configuration file for your website if it runs on an Apache server.
- `.DS_Store` - an invisible file that gets created anytime you look into a folder with the “Finder” on a mac. It then follows the folder everywhere it goes and just holds metadata about the folder.
