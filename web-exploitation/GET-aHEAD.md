The block of code suggests that there are 2 http methods:
- a GET request that corresponds to the red button
- a POST request that corresponds to the blue button

As the name of the challenge suggests, it wants you to make a HEAD request to the given url at http://mercury.picoctf.net:45028/index.php?

More information on the HEAD method can be found [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/HEAD).

You can make a head request in python with the following code:

```python
import requests

response = requests.head("http://mercury.picoctf.net:45028/index.php?")
print(response.headers)
```

Alternatively, you can also make a HEAD request with the CURL command in the terminal:

``
curl -I http://mercury.picoctf.net:53554/index.php
```
